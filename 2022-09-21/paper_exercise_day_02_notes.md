* What is CNV/CNA? <br>
  Copy number variants (CNA) refers to (germline) changes in number of gene copies in the genome of an individual. <br>
  Copy number abberations (CNVs) refers to (somatic) changes resulting in deletion or amplification of large contiguous segments of the genome.


* How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)? <br>
  Largest freely available cancer mutation database with individual sample data from various sources.

* Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships.<br>
  
  
* What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them? What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?<br>
  CNV frequency in Progenetix: Divide the genome into 1Mb-size bins and then count the occurrences of gain/loss events for all bins in the      selected samples

* How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles?<br>


* What do you think should be improved in progenetix?<br>
  New tools of clinical and diagnostical use could be implemented.
